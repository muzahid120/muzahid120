<h>ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Sk Muzahid  a self-taught data science enthusiast driven by a story of resilience and relentless pursuit of knowledge.</h>

ðŸ’¡ My journey into the world of data science wasn't traditional. Financial challenges cast a shadow over my academic aspirations, forcing me to pause my studies. For years, I worked tirelessly, dreaming of the day I could pursue my passion for learning.

ðŸ“š It was only after overcoming these obstacles, with the purchase of a PC marking a turning point, that I could reignite my educational journey. Last year, fueled by determination, I took on the challenge of self-teaching calculus, statistics, and linear algebra, laying the groundwork for my exploration of data science.

ðŸš€ Today, I'm diving into the depths of deep learning and computer vision, captivated by their potential to transform how we interact with and understand visual data. Concurrently, I'm sharpening my skills in web development, blending creativity with functionality to craft captivating online experiences.

ðŸŒŸ My path may not have been conventional, but it's taught me the power of perseverance and the value of seizing opportunities. Every hurdle only fueled my determination to succeed.

ðŸŽ“ With each step forward, I embrace the journey of self-improvement, turning challenges into stepping stones towards my goals.
